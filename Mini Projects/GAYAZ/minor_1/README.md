 # <i> HDL BITS SOLUTIONS </i>

HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). Earlier problems follow a tutorial style, while later problems will increasingly challenge your circuit design skills.

Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.

#### <i> Getting Started </i>

Getting started is just beginning of the hdl bits solutions.It teaches how to assign 1 and 0 to a variable in the binary form.
#### <i>Verilog Languages</i>

It has basics of the verilog language like logic gates, vectors, modules, procedures,etc
#### <i> Circuits</i>
In this topic we write code mainly for circuits like combinational circuits and sequential circuits.
In the combination circuits we will see the following circuits
Basic Gates
Multiplexers
Arthmetic Circuits
Karnaugh Map For Circuits 

In the sequential circuits we will see the following circuits
Latches and Filp Flops
Counters
Shift Registers
